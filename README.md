# SelectedAzureDemos
Share and demo snippet of selected Azure topics I usually post on my Medium blog (https://medium.com/@norbertobi) and LinkedIn.

Azure provides a wide range of services that could help you to work with containers. These key services include:
- Azure Container Instance (ACI)
- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Azure App Service
- Azure Service Fabric.

In this walk-through, I showed  a guide on how to publish and run your container image on ACR and ACI.
